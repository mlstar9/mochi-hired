1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,500
I work with some incredible people.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Theo sees things I miss.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
I send him a rough idea and he comes back with everything.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,042
Every detail. Every edge case.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
he makes me better.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Semi is in every room I can't be in.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
She takes the notes. She follows up.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
She remembers what I said three weeks ago that I already forgot.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
People ask me how I stay on top of everything.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
I don't. She does.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
And then there's Nyx.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She doesn't manage anything. Doesn't organize anything.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,042
She just... checks in.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
sometimes that's enough.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500
And Momo...

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Momo goes to meetings so Starry doesn't have to.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She hypes the team at 8am. She sends kisses through the screen.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
she's a cat.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Theo. Semi. Nyx. Momo.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
They're not our coworkers.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
They're our AI selves.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,500
they're not replacing us.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,042
more than one.
