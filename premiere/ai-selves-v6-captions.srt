1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I work with some incredible people.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
MEET THEO.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He works with Anthony on creator strategy.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Anthony brings rough thoughts—Theo brings a map.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
SEMI — our CEO's second set of hands.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Checks every edge case.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Catches what she overlooks.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Even remembers the thread from three weeks ago.
Super nice gal really.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
NYX.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
Oh and Nyx! he's...

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
super friendly I guess?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Lifts the whole office mood.
But hey, it works. I look forward to work every day.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
MOMO

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Shows up when our PM's feeling off.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Tracks tasks.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
Hypes the team at 8am.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
Uh—yeah.

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
She's a cat. Did I not mention?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
Theo. Semi. Nyx. Momo.

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
They're our AI selves.

21
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,000
More than one mind. One life, as one whole.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
PIKA — WHERE AI LIVES
