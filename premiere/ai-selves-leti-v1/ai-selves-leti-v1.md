## SCRIPT

**LETI (to camera):**
You're not gonna believe this but — our company used our own product, AI Selves, to push the actual product.

Let me explain.

**LETI (V.O.):**
This is Anthony, our head of partnerships.

And this is Theo.

Theo monitors our brand mentions in real time —

— and helped Anthony evaluate partnership opportunities around the clock for the launch.

> *[Show Theo and Anthony talking on Slack]*

Starry, our product manager —

> *[Show Starry — real photo, name + title]*

— uses Momo.

> *[Show Momo avatar + "(her AI Self)" with SFX ding]*

CUTE.

Momo handles Linear tasks across all departments — and even goes on Zoom calls when Starry doesn't feel like it!

Rus, our head of design —

> *[Show Rus — real photo, name + title]*

— uses Russ.

And this is Matan, our Creative Director.

His Raccoon 2.0 —

Oh, and all of them report up to our CEO, Demi Guo.

> *[Show Demi — real photo, name + title]*

Well… not exactly. They report to Semi —

> *[Show Semi avatar + "(her AI Self)" with SFX ding]*

## THE ENDING

**LETI (to camera):**
And me? I'm Leti, and I usually make videos, buuuut—

> *[MEOW — interrupts mid-sentence]*

**[HARD CUT]** to Mochi at a desk, two monitors, smashing keyboard. One screen has editing software, the other has a preview of THIS video.

> *[Show Mochi avatar + "(my AI Self)" with SFX ding]*

**LETI (offscreen, annoyed):**
Mochi— ffs, I'm in the middle of introducing yo—

**[GLITCH CUT]** back to Leti, trying to compose herself.

**LETI:**
Anyways, I'm—

**[GLITCH]** to Mochi on screen, looking directly at camera, annoyed.

**LETI (offscreen):**
What?? What do you need from me—

oh. Oh! You're done editing the video? Ok ok lemme check it out.

**[Camera slowly zooms into Mochi's monitor showing the video preview]**

**[The video on screen starts playing from the very beginning]**

## NOTES
- Real photos + titles for team members
- Avatars for AI Selves with consistent "(his/her/my AI Self)" label + SFX
- No Pika branding, no Telka font — this is Leti's personal video
- The loop ending works best if the zoom-in is smooth and the audio matches seamlessly
- Every "(AI Self)" reveal should have the same subtle SFX (bell/ding) for rhythm
