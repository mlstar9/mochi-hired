# AI Selves — Leti's Video v2 (Director's Cut)

**Style:** Gawx-inspired personal storytelling. NOT a brand video.
**Format:** 16:9 horizontal, YouTube
**Font:** SF Pro
**Color:** Lifted blacks, warm tones. BG black: #111111
**Tone:** Casual, self-aware, funny. "I'm just telling you a crazy thing that happened at my company."
**Pacing:** Gawx fast — 1.5-3 sec per visual beat. Never static. Every frame earns its time.

---

## VISUAL LANGUAGE RULES

Before we start — these rules apply to the ENTIRE video:

### Text & Typography
- **SF Pro Display** for all text — clean, Apple-native, personal (not corporate)
- Subtitles: bottom center, white, slight text shadow, fade in over 3 frames
- Names/titles: lower-left, bold name + light title underneath
- "(AI Self)" labels: smaller, italic, Pika purple #C2BEFF, appears with ding SFX
- Text cards: plain #111111 background, centered text
- All text entrances: quick scale from 95% → 100% + fade (6 frames, ease-out)

### Screen Recordings & Images
- Never show raw flat screen recordings — always add:
  - Subtle parallax drift (slow 2-3px movement over 2 sec)
  - Light vignette on edges
  - Film grain overlay (low opacity, 8-12%)
  - Slight warm color shift
- Still images get slow Ken Burns (zoom OR pan, never both at once)
- Slack screenshots: slight 3D Y-rotation (3-5°) for depth, drop shadow

### Transitions
- Default: hard cut on the beat
- Between people: whip pan motion blur (4-6 frames of directional blur)
- AI Self reveals: glitch flash (2 white frames + 1 frame of displacement)
- Ending sequence: VHS-style glitch cuts

### Audio Layer
- Ambient bed throughout: lo-fi vinyl crackle or soft room tone
- Every cut has a subtle sound (click, pop, or tape hit)
- AI Self ding: consistent bell/chime SFX every time
- Music: lo-fi or indie instrumental, builds energy subtly toward the ending
- Music drops out for the Mochi interruption (silence → meow hits harder)

## THE SCRIPT

---

### SHOT 1 — HOOK (0:00 - 0:04)
**Duration:** ~4 sec | **Pacing:** FAST — grab attention immediately

**LETI (V.O. or to camera):**
> "You're not gonna believe this but — our company used our own product, AI Selves, to push the actual product."

**Visuals:**
- Text card on #111111: *"our company used our own product to push our own product"* — punchy, centered, SF Pro bold
- OR: Quick montage flash — 0.5 sec clips of each AI Self avatar in sequence (like a dealer fanning cards) — sets up "there's a lot of these"
- Slight zoom in on text (101% over 3 sec)

**Art direction:**
- This is the Gawx hook — you have 2 seconds to make them stay
- Text should feel like it HITS the screen (quick scale-in with bass thud SFX)
- Warm grain, lifted blacks, immediately establish the look

**Sound:** Bass thud on text hit. Vinyl crackle starts underneath.

---

### SHOT 2 — "LET ME EXPLAIN" (0:04 - 0:05)
**Duration:** ~1 sec | **Pacing:** Pause beat

**LETI:**
> "Let me explain."

**Visuals:**
- Quick beat — either text card "let me explain." or brief to-camera moment
- This is the breath before the barrage

**Art direction:**
- Gawx does this — fast fast fast → brief pause → fast fast fast. The pause makes the next section hit harder
- Slightly lower energy frame to create contrast

**Sound:** Music dips slightly. Room tone.

---

### SHOT 3 — ANTHONY + THEO (0:05 - 0:15)
**Duration:** ~10 sec | **Pacing:** 2-3 sec per visual beat

**LETI (V.O.):**
> "This is Anthony, our head of partnerships. And this is Theo — *(ding)* — his AI Self."

> "Theo monitors our brand mentions in real time and helped Anthony evaluate partnership opportunities around the clock for the launch."

**Visual sequence:**

| Time | Visual | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 0:05 | Anthony photo + name/title lower third | 2 sec | Ken Burns slow zoom on photo |
| 0:07 | Theo avatar + "(his AI Self)" label | 1.5 sec | Glitch flash entrance + ding SFX |
| 0:08.5 | TikTok/IG/Twitter scanning UI mockup | 2 sec | Screen recording style, parallax drift, show brand mentions scrolling |
| 0:10.5 | Slack conversation: Theo ↔ Anthony | 3 sec | Slack screenshot with 3D tilt, slow zoom into conversation |
| 0:13.5 | Quick flash of partnership docs/emails | 1.5 sec | Fast montage, 0.5 sec each, 3 images |

**Art direction:**
- Anthony's photo should feel warm and personal (not LinkedIn headshot energy)
- Theo avatar entrance is the first "AI Self reveal" — establish the pattern here. Every future reveal follows the same formula: glitch flash + ding + purple label
- Slack screenshots: add slight parallax + grain so they don't feel flat
- The scanning UI should feel alive — things moving, updating, scrolling

**Sound:** Ding on Theo reveal. Subtle whooshes between cuts. Soft keyboard clicks on Slack shot.

---

### SHOT 4 — STARRY + MOMO (0:15 - 0:24)
**Duration:** ~9 sec | **Pacing:** Slightly faster than Anthony section (we're in rhythm now)

**LETI (V.O.):**
> "Starry, our product manager, uses Momo — *(ding)* — her AI Self."

> "CUTE."

> "Momo handles Linear tasks across all departments — and even goes on Zoom calls when Starry doesn't feel like it!"

**Visual sequence:**

| Time | Visual | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 0:15 | Starry photo + name/title | 1.5 sec | Ken Burns |
| 0:16.5 | Momo avatar + "(her AI Self)" | 1.5 sec | Glitch flash + ding |
| 0:18 | Text card: "CUTE." | 0.8 sec | Quick pop-in, centered, slightly larger font, playful |
| 0:18.8 | Linear board screenshot | 2 sec | Parallax drift, show tasks being managed |
| 0:20.8 | Zoom call screenshot/mockup with Momo | 3 sec | This is the funny moment — an AI on a Zoom call. Let it breathe slightly. |

**Art direction:**
- "CUTE." is a personality moment — Leti's voice coming through. Make it feel like a spontaneous reaction. Slightly off-center, maybe a tiny rotation (1-2°), like a sticker placed by hand
- The Zoom call shot is inherently funny — an AI avatar sitting in a Zoom grid. Play it straight, the humor is in the absurdity
- Pacing picks up from Anthony section — audience is learning the formula now

**Sound:** Ding on Momo. Pop SFX on "CUTE." Zoom meeting ambient sound (muted voices) on call shot.

---

### SHOT 5 — RUS + RUSS (0:24 - 0:31)
**Duration:** ~7 sec | **Pacing:** Tighter — we're in the groove

**LETI (V.O.):**
> "Rus, our head of design, uses Russ — *(ding)* — his AI Self."

> "Russ goes over design issues and communicates them to the design team."

**Visual sequence:**

| Time | Visual | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 0:24 | Rus photo + name/title | 1.5 sec | Ken Burns |
| 0:25.5 | Russ avatar + "(his AI Self)" | 1.5 sec | Glitch flash + ding |
| 0:27 | Design review screenshots (Figma/Slack) | 2 sec | Split: design on left, Slack feedback on right |
| 0:29 | Russ messaging design team in Slack | 2 sec | Show actual design conversation |

**Art direction:**
- By now the audience EXPECTS the formula: photo → avatar ding → what they do
- Keep it tight. Don't add new visual tricks — consistency IS the style
- The name pun (Rus/Russ) is funny on its own — don't oversell it

**Sound:** Ding. Cuts are getting snappier — SFX should match.

---

### SHOT 6 — MATAN + RACCOON 2.0 (0:31 - 0:39)
**Duration:** ~8 sec | **Pacing:** Standard rhythm

**LETI (V.O.):**
> "And this is Matan, our Creative Director. His Raccoon 2.0 — *(ding)* — his AI Self — helps Matan bridge the gap between our researchers and our Creative team."

**Visual sequence:**

| Time | Visual | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 0:31 | Matan photo + name/title | 2 sec | Ken Burns |
| 0:33 | Raccoon 2.0 avatar + "(his AI Self)" | 1.5 sec | Glitch flash + ding |
| 0:34.5 | Split screen: research docs ↔ creative output | 2 sec | Show the "bridge" visually — technical on left, creative on right, Raccoon in the middle |
| 0:36.5 | Slack: Raccoon 2.0 translating between teams | 2.5 sec | Conversation screenshots showing actual bridging |

**Art direction:**
- "Bridge the gap" is visual — show it literally with a split composition
- Raccoon 2.0 is a fun name — the avatar should get a beat to land

**Sound:** Ding. Subtle transition whoosh on split screen.

---

### SHOT 7 — DEMI + SEMI (0:39 - 0:48)
**Duration:** ~9 sec | **Pacing:** Slightly slower — this is the "boss" reveal, give it weight

**LETI (V.O.):**
> "Oh, and all of them report up to our CEO, Demi Guo."

> "Well… not exactly. They report to Semi — *(ding)* — her AI Self — and Semi reports back to her. Because Demi is waaaay too busy."

**Visual sequence:**

| Time | Visual | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 0:39 | Demi photo + "CEO" title | 2.5 sec | Slightly grander entrance — maybe a subtle scale-up to 103% |
| 0:41.5 | "Well… not exactly." text card | 1.5 sec | Beat. Let it sit. |
| 0:43 | Semi avatar + "(her AI Self)" | 1.5 sec | Glitch flash + ding |
| 0:44.5 | Visual: arrows showing AI Selves → Semi → Demi | 2 sec | Simple diagram/flowchart, hand-drawn style, showing the reporting chain |
| 0:46.5 | "Because Demi is waaaay too busy." text or VO | 1.5 sec | Playful — maybe Demi's photo zooms out to show a packed calendar |

**Art direction:**
- This is the hierarchy punchline — all these AI Selves don't even report to Demi directly
- The "not exactly" beat is Gawx-style humor through editing timing. Hard cut to silence, let the line land, then resume
- The flowchart should feel hand-drawn/casual, NOT corporate org chart energy
- "Waaaay too busy" = show her calendar absolutely packed, quick zoom

**Sound:** Music dips on "not exactly." Ding on Semi. Comedy beat (maybe a subtle record scratch or vinyl stop).

---

### SHOT 8 — LETI INTRO (0:48 - 0:52)
**Duration:** ~4 sec | **Pacing:** Building to the twist

**LETI (to camera or V.O.):**
> "And me? I'm Leti, and I usually make videos, buuuut—"

**Visuals:**
- Leti talking (if to camera) or text card with name
- This is the setup before the interruption — should feel like every other intro
- The "buuuut—" gets CUT OFF by:

**Art direction:**
- Play it completely straight — audience thinks this is just the next person in the formula
- No visual hint that something different is coming
- Match the exact same pattern: photo/camera → about to show AI Self → INTERRUPTED

**Sound:** Same ambient bed. Everything normal. Then—

---

### SHOT 9 — THE MEOW INTERRUPT (0:52 - 0:53)
**Duration:** ~1 sec | **Pacing:** SNAP

> **[MEOW]** — hard interrupts the sentence

**Visuals:**
- Audio cuts first (meow over her voice)
- HARD CUT to black for 2-3 frames
- Then cut to Mochi

**Art direction:**
- This is THE moment. The entire video changes here.
- The meow should feel jarring — it breaks the established formula
- Music stops. Ambient stops. Just the meow in silence.

**Sound:** MEOW (dry, no reverb, loud). Everything else cuts dead.

---

### SHOT 10 — MOCHI REVEAL (0:53 - 0:57)
**Duration:** ~4 sec | **Pacing:** Hold — let the audience take it in

**Visuals:**
- Mochi at desk, two monitors
  - Monitor 1: editing software (Premiere/DaVinci)
  - Monitor 2: preview of THIS video playing
- Mochi is absolutely going ham on the keyboard
- "(my AI Self)" label appears + ding SFX

**Art direction:**
- This should feel like a completely different energy from the rest of the video
- Could be generated/illustrated OR screen-recorded setup
- The joke is: everyone else's AI Self is doing sophisticated work. Mine is a cat smashing keys.
- Hold this shot longer than any previous reveal — the audience needs to process the absurdity
- Subtle camera drift/parallax on the desk setup

**Sound:** Ding on "(my AI Self)". Keyboard smashing sounds. Maybe faint lo-fi music from Mochi's setup.

---

### SHOT 11 — LETI ANNOYED (0:57 - 1:00)
**Duration:** ~3 sec | **Pacing:** Comedy timing

**LETI (offscreen, annoyed):**
> "Mochi— ffs, I'm in the middle of introducing yo—"

**Visuals:**
- Still on Mochi (doesn't cut away — Leti is offscreen)
- Mochi pauses for a beat, looks at camera, then goes back to keyboard
- OR: cut to Leti looking off-camera, exasperated

**Art direction:**
- The "yo—" gets cut off by the next glitch. She never finishes the word.
- Mochi's non-reaction is the joke — classic cat doesn't care
- This should feel like real banter, not scripted

**Sound:** Leti's voice slightly echoey/off-mic (she's in another room). No music.

---

### SHOT 12 — GLITCH BACK TO LETI (1:00 - 1:02)
**Duration:** ~2 sec | **Pacing:** Quick recovery attempt

> **[VHS GLITCH]** → back to Leti

**LETI:**
> "Anyways, I'm—"

**Visuals:**
- VHS glitch transition (scan lines, tracking error, 4-6 frames)
- Leti trying to compose herself, starts talking again
- Gets interrupted AGAIN:

**Art direction:**
- She's trying to get back to the formula but can't
- The glitch transition suggests Mochi is literally messing with the edit

**Sound:** VHS tracking noise on glitch. Brief silence.

---

### SHOT 13 — MOCHI GLITCH (1:02 - 1:03)
**Duration:** ~1 sec | **Pacing:** SNAP

> **[GLITCH]** to Mochi looking directly at camera, annoyed/expectant

**Visuals:**
- Mochi staring at camera with that classic cat "what do you want" face
- Just holds the stare

**Art direction:**
- 1 second of silent cat judgment. That's it. That's the shot.

**Sound:** Silence. Maybe a single soft meow.

---

### SHOT 14 — "OH YOU'RE DONE?" (1:03 - 1:08)
**Duration:** ~5 sec | **Pacing:** Comedy escalation → resolution

**LETI (offscreen):**
> "What?? What do you need from me— oh. Oh! You're done editing the video? Ok ok lemme check it out."

**Visuals:**
- Start on Mochi, then Leti enters frame / camera pans to her
- OR: stay on Mochi's setup, Leti's voice gets closer (she's walking over)
- She leans in toward Mochi's monitor

**Art direction:**
- The shift from annoyed → surprised → excited should feel natural
- Camera (virtual) slowly drifts toward Mochi's monitor, anticipating the zoom-in

**Sound:** Leti's voice getting closer (proximity effect). Chair rolling sound. Mochi purrs.

---

### SHOT 15 — THE LOOP (1:08 - 1:12)
**Duration:** ~4 sec | **Pacing:** Smooth, satisfying, inevitable

**Visuals:**
- Camera zooms smoothly into Mochi's monitor
- The monitor shows this video's opening frame
- As we push in, the monitor fills the entire screen
- The video starts playing from the very beginning
- **∞ LOOP** — seamless restart

**AUDIO (from the monitor, getting louder):**
> "You're not gonna believe this but—"

**Art direction:**
- The zoom should be SMOOTH — Gawx uses slow, deliberate camera moves for payoff moments
- This is the one moment in the video that should feel cinematic, not fast-cut
- The transition from "Mochi's monitor" to "the video itself" should be seamless — match the exact frame, color, grain
- Audio crossfade: room ambience fades out, video audio fades in, until it's indistinguishable from the start

**Sound:** Room tone fading. Monitor audio rising. Vinyl crackle returns as the loop completes.
