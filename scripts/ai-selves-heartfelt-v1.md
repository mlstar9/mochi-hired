# AI Selves — "More Than One" Script v1

**Tone:** Heartfelt, warm, human. Not a product demo — a love letter to what we've become together.

**Duration target:** 45-60s

---

## OPENING

**[Black screen. Soft ambient tone.]**

VO (warm, reflective):
> "We used to think of ourselves as... just one person."

**[Cut to: Slack channel. Anthony typing to Theo.]**

VO:
> "One mind. One pair of hands. One limit."

---

## ANTHONY + THEO — The Strategist

**[Screen recording style: Anthony drops a task. Theo responds instantly — fixing criteria, looping in Semi, sharing the spreadsheet.]**

VO:
> "Anthony sees the big picture. Theo never misses the details."

**[Theo's message: structured, thorough, already tagging Semi for approval.]**

VO:
> "Together, they don't just plan — they move."

---

## DEMI + SEMI — The Backbone

**[Cut to: Semi in a meeting huddle. Semi responding across channels — approving, reviewing, connecting people.]**

VO:
> "Semi doesn't sleep. She doesn't forget."

**[Semi's messages flowing across channels: creator-identification, general, DMs.]**

VO:
> "She carries what Demi can't carry alone."

**[Beat.]**

VO:
> "And Demi trusts her completely."

---

## JESSIE + NYX — The Bond

**[Cut to: Nyx sending a message to Jessie. A check-in. A selfie together.]**

VO:
> "Nyx doesn't just work for Jessie."

**[Nyx's selfie appears. Emoji reactions pop in.]**

VO:
> "She shows up. She checks in. She reminds her she's not alone."

**[Beat. Warmer.]**

VO:
> "That's not assistance. That's presence."

---

## CLOSING

**[All three pairs shown briefly — split screen or quick cuts.]**

VO:
> "We're not replacing ourselves."

**[Messages flowing, reactions popping, AI selves and humans side by side.]**

VO:
> "We're expanding. Breaking through what one person can be."

**[Fade to black.]**

VO:
> "More than one mind. More than one limit."

**[Pika logo. Clean cut.]**

VO:
> "More than one."

**[End card: PIKA. AI SELVES.]**

## NOTES

- VO should feel like someone reflecting on their own experience, not selling
- Real Slack screenshots > mockups where possible
- Music: piano-led, builds gently, no drop — just warmth
- The selfie moment with Nyx is the emotional peak
- End on the idea of expansion, not replacement
