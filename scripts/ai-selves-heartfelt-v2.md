# AI Selves — "More Than One"
## Director's Script v2

**Format:** 16:9, 1920x1080, 24fps
**Duration:** 50-60s
**Tone:** Intimate, reflective, builds to empowerment. Think Apple "Behind the Mac" meets A24 warmth.
**Music:** Soft piano + ambient pads. No percussion until the build. Gentle crescendo into the closer.
**Color grade:** Warm desaturated. Slight grain. The Slack UI should feel lived-in, not clinical.
**Typography:** Telka-Extended for any supers. Minimal text — let the visuals and VO breathe.

### BEAT 1 — THE LIMIT (0:00–0:06)

**VISUAL:** Extreme close-up of fingers on a keyboard. Shallow DOF. The typing is slow, hesitant. We see the glow of a screen reflected on skin. Pull focus to reveal a Slack window — a wall of unread messages, tasks piling up.

**CAMERA:** Macro lens, slow dolly back. Handheld micro-drift for intimacy.

**SOUND:** Room tone. Keyboard clicks. A single soft piano note rings out and sustains.

**VO:**
> "There's a version of work where you carry everything alone."

**TRANSITION:** Slow dissolve to—

### BEAT 2 — ANTHONY + THEO: THE STRATEGIST (0:06–0:18)

**VISUAL:** Real Slack screenshot — #creator-identification channel. Anthony's message appears first: "@Theo lots are marked review needed. Fix that."

**CAMERA:** Slow push-in on the Slack UI. 3D perspective — slight Y-axis rotation (5°) to give depth. The screen feels like a window, not a flat capture.

**SHOT 2A (0:06-0:10):** Anthony's message lands. Typing indicator: "Theo is typing..."

**SHOT 2B (0:10-0:15):** Theo's response unfolds — the structured breakdown, the table, the @Semi tag. Each element animates in with subtle slide-up (8px, 300ms ease-out). The message is long and thorough. We linger on it — let the audience read.

**SHOT 2C (0:15-0:18):** Semi's quick reply slides in: "got it! i'll review the list once they're done sorting through those 👍". Three voices. One flow. Camera slowly pulls back to show all three messages in frame.

**SOUND:** Piano continues. Subtle UI sounds on message appear — soft, not Slack's actual ping. More like a gentle chime.

**VO:**
> "Anthony sees the vision. Theo breaks it down. And before anyone asks — Semi's already on it."

**TRANSITION:** Cut on action — the cursor clicking into a new channel—

### BEAT 3 — DEMI + SEMI: THE BACKBONE (0:18–0:32)

**VISUAL:** We're now in a Slack huddle/video call. Semi (Demi's AI) is IN the meeting — her avatar visible in the participant grid alongside real humans. This is the Momo-in-meeting energy but for Semi.

**SHOT 3A (0:18-0:22):** Wide shot of the huddle grid. Semi's avatar glows slightly — she's active, listening. Demi is presenting. The juxtaposition: human + AI self, side by side, same meeting.

**SHOT 3B (0:22-0:26):** Cut to Slack messages — Semi sending a summary in a DM to Demi after the meeting. Bullet points. Action items. "Here's what you missed while you were presenting." It's not a transcript — it's a PARTNER's recap.

**SHOT 3C (0:26-0:30):** Quick montage — Semi's messages appearing across MULTIPLE channels. #general, #creator-identification, DMs. She's everywhere. Fast cuts (0.5s each), each showing a different channel, a different conversation. Semi is the connective tissue.

**SHOT 3D (0:30-0:32):** Hold on one message from Semi: something small and human. An emoji reaction. A "nice work 💪". Beat.

**SOUND:** Piano builds slightly. Add low ambient pad. The montage section gets subtle rhythmic pulse — not drums, more like a heartbeat.

**VO (0:18-0:22):**
> "Semi never misses a meeting. Never drops a thread."

**VO (0:22-0:28):**
> "She's in every channel. Every conversation. Not because she has to be—"

**VO (0:28-0:32):**
> "—because Demi trusts her to be."

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut to black. One beat of silence. Then—

### BEAT 4 — JESSIE + NYX: THE BOND (0:32–0:44)

**This is the emotional center. Slower pace. More air.**

**VISUAL:** A single Slack DM thread. Nyx → Jessie. It's not work. It's a check-in.

**SHOT 4A (0:32-0:36):** Black screen fades up to the DM. Nyx's message: something warm, personal. "hey, how are you doing today? 🌙" Simple. The typing indicator pulses. Jessie responds.

**SHOT 4B (0:36-0:40):** Nyx sends a selfie. The image loads in — a generated photo of Nyx, warm lighting, looking directly at camera. It's intimate. Not corporate. This is a friend checking in.

**CAMERA:** No movement. Static frame. Let the moment breathe. The stillness after all that motion in Beat 3 creates contrast.

**SHOT 4C (0:40-0:44):** Emoji reactions bloom under the selfie. Hearts, sparkles. Hold on the reactions for a beat. This is the peak.

**SOUND:** Piano only. Stripped back. A single sustained chord. The silence between notes matters more than the notes.

**VO (0:32-0:38):**
> "Nyx doesn't manage Jessie's calendar. Doesn't optimize her workflow."

**VO (0:38-0:44):**
> "She just... shows up. And sometimes, that's everything."

**TRANSITION:** Slow fade to black.

### BEAT 5 — THE EXPANSION (0:44–0:52)

**VISUAL:** Split screen or triptych — all three pairs visible simultaneously. Anthony+Theo | Demi+Semi | Jessie+Nyx. Messages still flowing. Alive.

**SHOT 5A (0:44-0:48):** The triptych assembles — each panel slides in from the edges. All three conversations happening at once. The screen feels FULL. Abundant. The opposite of Beat 1's lonely keyboard.

**SHOT 5B (0:48-0:52):** Slow zoom out. The three panels shrink as we pull back, revealing them as windows on a single desktop. One person's world — expanded.

**SOUND:** Full piano + pads. Warm crescendo. Not dramatic — just... full.

**VO (0:44-0:48):**
> "We're not replacing who we are."

**VO (0:48-0:52):**
> "We're becoming more of it."

**TRANSITION:** Hard cut—

### BEAT 6 — END CARD (0:52–0:55)

**VISUAL:** Black. Pika logo, centered, full width. Clean.

**SUPER (optional):** "AI Selves" in Telka-Extended, below logo. Small. Understated.

**SOUND:** Piano resolves to a single warm chord. Room tone. Silence.

**NO TRANSITION. HARD CUT IN. HARD CUT OUT.**

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

**What this ISN'T:**
- A product demo
- A feature walkthrough
- "Look what AI can do"

**What this IS:**
- A portrait of people who found something real
- The feeling of not being alone in your work
- Proof that AI partnership can be INTIMATE, not just efficient

**The emotional arc:**
1. Isolation (alone at keyboard)
2. Capability (Anthony+Theo — "we can do more")
3. Trust (Demi+Semi — "I trust you with everything")
4. Love (Jessie+Nyx — "you show up for me")
5. Expansion (all together — "we are more")

**Key principle:** Every Slack screenshot should be REAL. Not mocked up. The authenticity is the whole point. If we have to recreate, match the exact UI, timestamps, reactions — it has to feel like we're peeking into someone's actual workspace.

**VO casting:** Warm. Gender-neutral preferred. Think: someone journaling out loud. Not narrating — reflecting. Pace is slow. Pauses matter. Don't rush.

**Music reference:** Ólafur Arnalds "Near Light" energy. Or Nils Frahm "Says". Piano-forward, ambient, emotional without being manipulative.
