00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
You're not gonna believe this but —

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,000
our company used our own product, AI Selves,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
to push the actual product.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let me explain.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is Anthony, our head of partnerships.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And this is Theo.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
(his AI Self)

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Theo monitors our brand mentions in real time —

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and helped Anthony evaluate partnership opportunities

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
around the clock for the launch.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Starry, our product manager —

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
uses Momo.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
(her AI Self)

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,800
CUTE.

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
Momo handles Linear tasks across all departments —

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and even goes on Zoom calls
when Starry doesn't feel like it!

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Rus, our head of design —

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
uses Russ.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
(his AI Self)

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Russ goes over design issues

21
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
and communicates them to the design team.

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
And this is Matan, our Creative Director.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,500
His Raccoon 2.0 —

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,500
(his AI Self)

25
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
helps Matan bridge the gap between

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
our researchers and our Creative team.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, and all of them report up
to our CEO, Demi Guo.

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Well… not exactly.

29
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,000
They report to Semi —

30
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,000
(her AI Self)

31
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
and Semi reports back to her.

32
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Because Demi is waaaay too busy.

33
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And me? I'm Leti, and I usually
make videos, buuuut—

34
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,500
[MEOW]

35
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
(my AI Self)

36
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:62,000
Mochi— ffs, I'm in the middle
of introducing yo—

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Anyways, I'm—

38
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
What?? What do you need from me—

39
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
oh. Oh! You're done editing the video?

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Ok ok lemme check it out.

41
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
"You're not gonna believe this but—"
