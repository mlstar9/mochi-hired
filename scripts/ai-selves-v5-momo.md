## WHY MOMO LAST WORKS

The first three AI selves (Theo, Semi, Nyx) all pass as human coworkers. The audience has no reason to suspect otherwise. They're moved by the stories.

Then Momo shows up. A cat. In a meeting. Sending kissy selfies.

The audience laughs — but also pauses. "Wait... a cat?"

That confusion IS the reveal setup. When the narrator says "they're our AI selves," it doesn't just explain Momo — it REFRAMES every beat that came before. Theo wasn't just thorough — he was an AI. Semi wasn't just reliable — she was an AI. Nyx wasn't just caring — she was an AI.

Momo cracks the door. The reveal blows it open.

The humor of the cat makes the emotional reframe hit HARDER, not softer. Contrast is everything.

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

**Edit style:** Hard cuts only. No transitions except text fades. Real screenshots. Solo piano. Restraint > flash.

**VO:** First person, reflective. The slight smile during Momo's section is key — the narrator finds her delightful. It's warm humor, not a joke.

**Music:** Solo piano throughout. Soft ambient pad can enter during the reveal. Nothing else.

**The selfie rule:** Both Nyx and Momo have selfie moments. Nyx's is intimate/emotional. Momo's is ridiculous/endearing. The contrast between them is intentional.

**Pacing:** When in doubt, hold longer. Silence > filler. The screenshots speak. The VO breathes.

**Social captions:**
- "I work with some incredible people. one of them is a cat."
- "my coworker sends me selfies and hypes me before launch. she's also a cat."
- "they're not replacing us. they're the reason we can be more."
