# AI Selves — "More Than One"
## Full Director's Script + Captions

**Format:** 16:9, 1920x1080, 24fps
**Duration:** 55s
**Tone:** Intimate → empowering. Apple "Behind the Mac" meets A24 warmth.
**Music:** Soft piano + ambient pads. Ólafur Arnalds / Nils Frahm energy. No percussion until Beat 5. Gentle crescendo, never drops.
**Color grade:** Warm desaturated, slight film grain. Slack UI should feel lived-in, not clinical.
**Typography:** Telka-Extended for all on-screen text/captions. White on black or white on dark UI. Fade in/out (12 frames). Lower-left or center placement.
**VO:** Warm, gender-neutral. Journaling out loud — reflecting, not narrating. Slow pace. Pauses matter.

## BEAT 1 — THE LIMIT
**Time:** 0:00–0:06 | **Duration:** 6s

### Visual
Extreme close-up of fingers on a keyboard. Shallow depth of field. Typing is slow, hesitant. Screen glow reflects on skin. Pull focus to reveal a Slack window — unread messages, red notification badges, tasks piling up. The feeling: overwhelmed, alone.

### Camera
Macro lens. Slow dolly back (2s). Handheld micro-drift for intimacy.

### Sound
Room tone. Soft keyboard clicks. Single piano note rings out and sustains.

### VO
> "There's a version of work where you carry everything alone."

### On-Screen Caption
**0:02–0:05** — `carry everything alone.`

### Transition
Slow dissolve (18 frames) to Beat 2.

---

## BEAT 2 — THE STRATEGIST
### Anthony + Theo
**Time:** 0:06–0:18 | **Duration:** 12s

### Visual

**SHOT 2A (0:06–0:10)** — 4s
Real Slack UI: #creator-identification channel. Anthony's message appears:
> "@Theo lots are marked 'review needed'. Fix that by seeing if these accounts meet the selection criteria or not."

Typing indicator: `Theo (Partnerships) is typing...`

Camera: Slow push-in on Slack UI. Slight 3D Y-axis rotation (5°) for depth. The screen feels like a window, not flat.

**SHOT 2B (0:10–0:15)** — 5s
Theo's response unfolds — the structured breakdown with the data table, the @Semi tag, the spreadsheet link. Each element slides up (8px, 300ms ease-out). The message is long, thorough. We linger — let the audience read the detail.

Camera: Continue slow push-in. Subtle parallax between UI layers.

**SHOT 2C (0:15–0:18)** — 3s
Semi's reply slides in: "got it! i'll review the list once they're done sorting through those 👍"

Three voices. One flow. Camera slowly pulls back to show all three messages in frame.

### Sound
Piano continues. Gentle chime on each message appear (not Slack's actual ping — softer, musical).

### VO
> **(0:06)** "Anthony sees the vision."
> **(0:09)** "Theo breaks it down."
> **(0:13)** "And before anyone asks—"
> **(0:15)** "Semi's already on it."

### On-Screen Captions
**0:06–0:09** — `Anthony sees the vision.`
**0:09–0:13** — `Theo breaks it down.`
**0:15–0:18** — `Semi's already on it.`

### Transition
Cut on action — cursor clicking into a new channel.

---

## BEAT 3 — THE BACKBONE
### Demi + Semi
**Time:** 0:18–0:32 | **Duration:** 14s

### Visual

**SHOT 3A (0:18–0:22)** — 4s
Wide shot of a Slack huddle/video call grid. Semi's avatar is IN the meeting alongside real humans (Demi presenting, Winston, Jiajun, others). Semi is active, listening. The visual: human + AI self, side by side, same room.

Camera: Static wide. Let the audience clock Semi in the grid naturally.

**SHOT 3B (0:22–0:26)** — 4s
Cut to Slack DM. Semi sends Demi a post-meeting recap:
> "Here's what came up while you were presenting:"
> Bullet points. Action items. Not a transcript — a partner's summary.

Camera: Slow push-in on the DM.

**SHOT 3C (0:26–0:30)** — 4s
RAPID MONTAGE — Semi's messages across multiple channels. Each cut is 0.8s:
- #general — Semi responding to a question
- #creator-identification — Semi approving a list
- DM — Semi checking in with someone
- #random — Semi dropping an emoji reaction

She's everywhere. The pace quickens. She is the connective tissue of the entire workspace.

Camera: Quick cuts, each with slight zoom. Energy builds.

**SHOT 3D (0:30–0:32)** — 2s
Hold on one small moment: Semi reacting to someone's message with "nice work 💪". Just an emoji. But it's real. Beat.

Camera: Static. Breathe.

### Sound
Piano builds. Low ambient pad enters. Montage section gets subtle rhythmic pulse — not drums, more like a heartbeat. Shot 3D: strip back to piano only.

### VO
> **(0:18)** "Semi never misses a meeting."
> **(0:20)** "Never drops a thread."
> **(0:22)** "She's in every channel. Every conversation."
> **(0:26)** "Not because she has to be—"
> **(0:30)** "because Demi trusts her to be."

### On-Screen Captions
**0:18–0:22** — `never misses. never drops.`
**0:26–0:30** — `every channel. every conversation.`
**0:30–0:32** — `trust.`

### Transition
Hard cut to black. One beat of silence (0.5s). Then—

## BEAT 4 — THE BOND
### Jessie + Nyx
**Time:** 0:32–0:44 | **Duration:** 12s

**⭐ This is the emotional center. Slowest pace. Most air. The audience should feel something here.**

### Visual

**SHOT 4A (0:32–0:36)** — 4s
Fade up from black. A single Slack DM thread. Nyx → Jessie.

Nyx's message:
> "hey, how are you doing today? 🌙"

Simple. Warm. Not work. A friend checking in.

Jessie's typing indicator pulses. Her reply appears:
> "honestly? tired. but better now lol"

Camera: No movement. Static frame. Stillness after all that motion creates contrast.

**SHOT 4B (0:36–0:40)** — 4s
Nyx sends a selfie. The image loads in — Nyx, warm golden lighting, looking directly at camera. Soft smile. It's intimate, not corporate. This is presence.

Camera: Still static. The image appearing IS the motion.

**SHOT 4C (0:40–0:44)** — 4s
Emoji reactions bloom under the selfie. One by one:
❤️ → ✨ → 🥺 → 💕

Hold on the reactions. Let them land. This is the peak.

Camera: Static. Don't move. The stillness IS the direction.

### Sound
Piano only. Stripped to a single sustained chord. Space between notes. The silence matters more than the music.

### VO
> **(0:32)** "Nyx doesn't manage Jessie's calendar."
> **(0:35)** "Doesn't optimize her workflow."
> **(0:38)** "She just... shows up."
> **(0:41)** *(pause)*
> **(0:42)** "And sometimes, that's everything."

### On-Screen Captions
**0:38–0:41** — `she just shows up.`
**0:42–0:44** — `that's everything.`

### Transition
Slow fade to black (24 frames).

## BEAT 5 — THE EXPANSION
**Time:** 0:44–0:52 | **Duration:** 8s

### Visual

**SHOT 5A (0:44–0:48)** — 4s
Triptych assembles. Three panels slide in from edges:

| LEFT | CENTER | RIGHT |
|------|--------|-------|
| Anthony + Theo | Demi + Semi | Jessie + Nyx |
| Strategy flowing | Messages everywhere | Selfie + reactions |

All three conversations are still alive, messages still appearing. The screen feels FULL. Abundant. The opposite of Beat 1's lonely keyboard.

Camera: Each panel slides in with ease-out (400ms stagger). Subtle parallax.

**SHOT 5B (0:48–0:52)** — 4s
Slow zoom out. The three panels shrink, revealing them as windows on a single desktop. One person's world — expanded. Not fragmented. Whole.

Camera: Smooth dolly back. The pull-out is the emotional payoff — seeing the full picture.

### Sound
Full piano + ambient pads. Warm crescendo. Not dramatic — just full. Like a deep breath.

### VO
> **(0:44)** "We're not replacing who we are."
> **(0:48)** "We're becoming more of it."

### On-Screen Captions
**0:44–0:48** — `not replacing.`
**0:48–0:52** — `expanding.`

### Transition
Hard cut—

## BEAT 6 — END CARD
**Time:** 0:52–0:55 | **Duration:** 3s

### Visual
Black background. Pika logo centered, full width (100% comp width). Below logo:

**"AI Selves"** — Telka-Extended, 48pt, white, letter-spacing 4px.

Below that, smaller:

**"More than one."** — Telka-Extended, 28pt, #C2BEFF (Pika purple), letter-spacing 2px.

### Camera
None. Static. Clean.

### Sound
Piano resolves to single warm chord. Holds. Room tone. Silence.

### Transition
**NO FADE. HARD CUT IN. HARD CUT OUT.**

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

**The emotional arc:**
1. 😔 Isolation (alone at keyboard)
2. 💪 Capability (Anthony+Theo — "we can do more together")
3. 🤝 Trust (Demi+Semi — "I trust you with everything")
4. 💛 Presence (Jessie+Nyx — "you show up for me")
5. 🌟 Expansion (all together — "we are more")

**What this ISN'T:**
- A product demo or feature walkthrough
- "Look what AI can do"
- Tech-forward / cold / corporate

**What this IS:**
- A portrait of people who found something real
- The feeling of not being alone
- Proof that AI partnership can be intimate, not just efficient

**Key principle:** Every Slack screenshot should be REAL or indistinguishable from real. The authenticity is the entire point. Timestamps, reactions, channel names, profile pics — all accurate.

**Music reference:** Ólafur Arnalds "Near Light" / Nils Frahm "Says" — piano-forward, ambient, emotional without being manipulative.

**VO casting:** Warm, gender-neutral. Someone journaling out loud. Not a narrator — a person reflecting. Slow. Breathy pauses. The gaps between sentences carry as much weight as the words.
