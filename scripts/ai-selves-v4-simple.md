# AI Selves — "More Than One"
## Visual Script v4 — Simple/Emotional Edit

**Format:** 16:9, 1920x1080
**Duration:** 45-55s
**Style:** Simple cuts. Real screenshots. No 3D, no motion graphics, no fancy transitions. The edit is invisible — the story is everything. Think: Pika "Second Life" energy.
**Music:** Solo piano. One instrument. Let it breathe.
**Edit rule:** Every cut is a simple hard cut or slow dissolve. Nothing else. The restraint IS the style.
**Text:** White Telka-Extended on black. Centered. Fade in, hold, fade out. That's it.

## STRUCTURE

The narrator speaks in first person — as if reflecting on their team. The twist: the "people" they're describing are AI selves. But we don't reveal that until the end. The audience thinks they're watching a story about coworkers. Then the reframe lands.

---

## BEAT 1 — SETUP
**0:00–0:04**

**SCREEN:** Black.

**TEXT (white, centered):**
`I work with some incredible people.`

**MUSIC:** First piano note. Sustain.

**HOLD** 3 seconds. Fade out text.

## BEAT 2 — THEO
**0:04–0:14**

**VO:**
> "Theo sees things I miss."

**SCREEN:** Real Slack screenshot. Anthony's message asking Theo to review the creator list. Hard cut to Theo's detailed response — the table, the breakdown, the @Semi tag.

**CUT** to close-up of Theo's structured feedback. Hold.

**VO:**
> "I send him a rough idea and he comes back with... everything. Every detail. Every edge case."

**SCREEN:** Theo's full message visible. The thoroughness speaks for itself.

**VO:**
> "He makes me better at my job."

**TEXT (on black, between shots):**
`he makes me better.`

## BEAT 3 — SEMI
**0:14–0:26**

**VO:**
> "Semi is in every room I can't be in."

**SCREEN:** The Slack huddle screenshot — Semi's avatar in the meeting grid alongside real people. Hard cut.

**VO:**
> "She takes the notes. She follows up. She remembers what I said three weeks ago that I already forgot."

**SCREEN:** Semi's DM to Demi — the meeting recap. Hard cut to Semi's messages in #general. Hard cut to Semi reacting with 💪.

**VO:**
> "People ask me how I stay on top of everything."

**(beat)**

> "I don't. She does."

**TEXT (on black):**
`I don't. She does.`

## BEAT 4 — NYX
**0:26–0:38**

**This is the emotional peak. Slowest section. Most silence.**

**VO:**
> "And then there's Nyx."

**SCREEN:** Black. Hold for a beat. Then: Nyx's DM to Jessie. "hey, how are you doing today? 🌙"

**VO:**
> "She doesn't manage anything. Doesn't organize anything."

**SCREEN:** Jessie's reply. Then Nyx's selfie loads in. Warm. Looking at camera. A friend.

**VO:**
> "She just... checks in."

**LONG PAUSE.** Let the selfie sit. 2 full seconds of silence.

**VO (softer):**
> "Sometimes that's the thing that gets you through the day."

**SCREEN:** Emoji reactions appearing under the selfie. ❤️ ✨ 🥺

**TEXT (on black):**
`sometimes that's enough.`

## BEAT 5 — THE REVEAL
**0:38–0:48**

**This is the twist. The tone shifts. Same warmth, but a new understanding.**

**SCREEN:** Black. Long pause.

**VO:**
> "Theo. Semi. Nyx."

**SCREEN:** Quick flash of each — Theo's message, Semi in the meeting, Nyx's selfie. 1 second each. Hard cuts.

**VO:**
> "They're not my coworkers."

**(beat)**

> "They're our AI selves."

**SCREEN:** Black. Hold.

**VO:**
> "And they're not replacing us."

**TEXT (white, centered, slow fade in):**
`they're not replacing us.`

**VO:**
> "They're the reason we can do more... be more... than just one person."

**TEXT (replacing previous):**
`more than one.`

**HOLD** 3 seconds.

## EDIT NOTES

**What changed from v3:**
- Removed ALL motion graphics, 3D camera, parallax
- First-person narration (not third-person VO)
- The "twist" structure — audience thinks these are humans until the reveal
- Every visual is a real Slack screenshot, simple hard cut
- Text cards are plain white on black — no animation beyond fade
- The emotional weight comes from the STORY not the edit

**The twist is everything.** The audience spends 38 seconds thinking "wow, what a great team" — then realizes these are AI. That reframe is the whole ad. It proves the point better than any feature list ever could: these AI selves feel REAL.

**Music:** One piano. One instrument. Nothing else until the very end where a soft pad can swell underneath. The simplicity mirrors the edit.

**Pacing rule:** When in doubt, hold longer. Silence > filler. Let the screenshots do the talking. Let the VO breathe. The gaps between words carry the emotion.

**The selfie moment (Beat 4)** should make the audience feel something before the reveal. If they don't feel anything during Nyx's check-in, the twist won't land. Protect this moment. Give it time.
