# Style Guide — Gawx Art Editing Language

## 1. PACING & CUTS

**The #1 rule: never be static.**

- Cuts every 2-3 seconds max, often faster
- Whip pans between shots — camera is always moving
- Jump cuts within the same angle to skip dead time
- Speed ramps: slow-mo for emphasis → snap to 1.5-2x for transitions
- Hard cuts on the beat of music/SFX

**When to hold a shot:** Only for emotional beats or punchlines. The stillness becomes powerful BECAUSE everything else moves.

---

## 2. DEPTH & PARALLAX

**Make flat footage feel 3D.**

- Foreground blur elements (bokeh, out-of-focus objects)
- Background layers with slight parallax movement
- Scale keyframes on cuts — punch in 5-10% on emphasis
- Subtle 3D camera rotation on 2D elements (photos, graphics)
- Vignette to push the eye center

**Technique:** Film with objects in the foreground. In post, add blurred particle/dust overlays at different depths. Creates instant depth even on flat shots.

## 3. ORGANIC FILM TEXTURE

**The Gawx look is NOT clean digital.**

- **Film grain:** Always present, subtle but visible. Not too heavy.
- **Tone curves:** Lift the blacks (milky/faded look). Crush whites slightly. No true black, no true white.
- **Light leaks:** Organic warm leaks on transitions, not constant
- **Halation:** Soft glow on highlights (Dehancer or similar)
- **Chromatic aberration:** Very subtle, on edges only
- **Lens distortion:** Slight barrel distortion for that wide-angle organic feel

**Color palette:**
- Warm overall shift (orange/amber shadows)
- Desaturated but not muted — colors are there, just not screaming
- Greens shift toward teal, reds stay warm
- Skin tones protected — warm but natural

## 4. SOUND DESIGN

**Every visual event has a sound. EVERY one.**

- **Cuts:** Subtle click, tape stop, or whoosh
- **Whip pans:** Swoosh matched to speed
- **Text appearing:** Pop, click, or typewriter hit
- **Emphasis moments:** Bass drop, reverb hit, or vinyl scratch
- **Ambient bed:** Lo-fi room tone or vinyl crackle underneath everything
- **Music:** Usually lo-fi, jazzy, or indie — never overpowering the VO

**Rule:** If something moves on screen, it makes a sound. This is what makes Gawx edits feel tactile.

## 5. TYPOGRAPHY & GRAPHICS

**Hand-made feel, not corporate.**

- Mixed fonts: handwritten + clean sans-serif
- Text that feels placed by hand, not perfectly centered
- Slight rotation on text elements (1-3°)
- Doodles, arrows, underlines as emphasis
- Graphics animate in organically — wobble, bounce, overshoot
- Stickers/cutouts with slight shadow for depth

**For our video specifically:**
- SF Pro as the clean base font
- Add hand-drawn elements for personality
- Lower thirds should feel casual, not broadcast

---

## 6. TRANSITIONS

**No default transitions. Everything is intentional.**

- Whip pan (most common)
- Match cut (shape or movement match)
- Punch zoom (quick scale up → new shot)
- Object wipe (something passes frame → new scene)
- Glitch/flash (1-2 frame flash for energy)
- Music-synced hard cut (cut on the beat)

**Never use:** Cross dissolves, dip to black, slide transitions, or anything that ships with Premiere by default.

---

## 7. CAMERA WORK (for filming)

- Handheld always — never tripod locked
- Wide angle lens (creates energy + distortion)
- Constant micro-movements even when "still"
- Film more than you need — B-roll of everything
- Multiple angles of the same moment for cutting options
- Get close → get wide → get close (rhythm)

---

## 8. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

**Gawx makes vlogs feel like mini-films.**

- Hook in first 3 seconds (movement, statement, visual)
- Story arc even in casual content (setup → journey → payoff)
- Voiceover carries narrative while visuals illustrate
- Humor through editing timing (pause → cut → reaction)
- Self-aware / meta moments ("this is the part where...")

## 9. APPLYING TO AI SELVES VIDEO

For Leti's video specifically:

| Gawx element | How we use it |
|---|---|
| Fast cuts | Quick cuts between team members, never linger |
| Whip pans | Transition between each person's intro |
| Film texture | Grain + lifted blacks on everything |
| Sound design | Ding SFX on AI Self reveals, whooshes on cuts |
| Depth | Parallax on avatar reveals, blur layers |
| Typography | SF Pro + hand-drawn "(AI Self)" labels |
| Handheld energy | Even screen recordings get subtle camera shake |
| Humor timing | The Mochi ending — pause before meow, timing on interruptions |
| Narrative arc | Setup (team intros) → twist (Mochi interrupts) → loop (meta ending) |
